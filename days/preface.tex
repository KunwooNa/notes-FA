\chapter*{Preface}
This is a note for the seminar on functional analysis held during winter, 2023. The material is taught by Professor Sang-Gyun Yoon at Seoul National University. As the materials discussed in the seminar provide an indispensable tools in the study of mathematics, I am writing the note that I can refer to later. \\[0.2cm]
As a matter of personal interest, I am very interested in the topics that are discussed in the seminar. For this reason, I am trying to grasp every detail of the contents and glue the knowledge in a decent manner. In order to reduce the cognitive loads that are required to capture the details of non-contiguous contents visited in the seminar, organizing my thoughts and the contents that I have been studying in a \LaTeX \ file must be valuable. This is the primary motive for me to write this note. \\[0.2cm]
